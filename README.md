# fm-scripts
Some bash that I use for personal file management.

Clone these to an fm-scripts folder on your system and create a symbolic link in your path (echo $PATH) to master-rsync.sh, somenting like this:
```
sudo ln -s /path/to/fm-scripts/master-rsync.sh /in/your/path/master-rsync
sudo chmod 775 /in/your/path/master-rsync
```
